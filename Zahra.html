       <p>My name is Zahra Khan and I am a CS major. Some CS languages that I know are Java, a little bit of python and a little bit of c++. I am interested in learning more about front-end and want to learn html. Some of my hobbies are that I like to travel, hike, photography and go on adventurous activities. Some interest I have are in cyberSecurtiy, data science and networking. At the moment, I'm mostly interested in learning new things such as web-development, data analyst and networks. </p>
