    <p>Who I am:</p>
    <pre>
        My name is Benjamin Rosado. My interest are in cybersecurtiy and astrophysics.
        In my free time, I enjoy video games, reading, or scrolling through TikTok for 5 hours.
        I hate the heat; the colder, the better. Given the inflated prices of homes, I have entertained
        The idea of building a home from clay, sand, straw, and dirt. It's called a COB home. Not sure what
        COB means, no it's not corn on the cob.
