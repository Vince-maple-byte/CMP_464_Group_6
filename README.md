If you see Konan Bryan anywhere, its just my computer user name so don't worry. Check inside branch "Master" for all files.
There may be image previews below. Also you can make changes to the style_option1.css and style_option2.css based on how you want it to look and we'll add them to the main after that.
IMPORTANT 
there are 4 files in this folder;
Readme.md, review_index.html and
1 folder called "css" which contains
style_option1.css and style_option2.css

NOTE: After cloning through ssh or HTTPS, locate the files on your system explorer and put/paste/place your index.html(which would have your first name for example Joe.html) in that directory otherwise it won't work. For example, i clone the files into my C://Downloads i would copy or move my index.html(in my case Joe.html) and paste it, not in the css folder, but with the Readme.md and the review_index.html in order to be able to use the .css files.

 Both the style_option1.css & style_option2.css are to be tested by each user with their index.html to see which one they like best, give feedback in the discord group [https://discord.gg/J5bTnWhv] and we all pick one because we all have to use the same css for our .html file. To demonstrate, Iverson for example, clones this folder containing all files[Readme.md, review_index.html, folder called "css" which contains style_option1.css, style_option2.css]. If he hasn't already, he creates his html code called "Iverson.html". He then locates where he cloned the files to and pastes a copy of his "Iverson.html" inside the folder. He goes to his "Iverson.html" code using VScode, Eclipse or whatever text editor he has, look in the <head></head> section of his "Iverson.html" and insert the link--> [Note, insert 1 .css link first, see how it looks on your website before you try the other link. Don't post both links in the <head></head> at the same time] "<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style_option1.css"/>" and when you are done with that, you put this link "<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style_option2.css"/>" Notice that the "css/" represents the folder css and "style_option1.css" & "style_option2.css.html" represents style_option1.css & style_option2.css. Next, he looks in the css file he linked, either style_option1.css or style_option2.css and checks the variable, in order to properly use them, like <div>, <p1>, <h>, <h1> and so forth. Pleae check online for resources on how to use the tags or ask questions in the discord if you need help, you don't have to work alone. 

   I also included a file called review_index.html for the purposes of evaluation. Meaning, every user checks it out in their browser or whatever environment you use and see how it feels. That review_index.html, is what will link all our .html together so please review it and share your feedback on how to make it better in the Discord link[https://discord.gg/J5bTnWhv]. 

 If you have any questions or you think i forgot something, Discord is the fastest place to get answers, PLEASE DONT STRUGGLE ALONE, we are here for eachother.
 Till next time. âœŒ
