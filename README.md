If you see Konan Bryan anywhere, that's my computer user name, i dont know how it got there so disregard that.
Note, the "review_index" found in the master branch and the index.html found in the main branch are the same.
There may be image and video previews below. Also you can make changes to the style_option1.css and style_option2.css based on how you want it to look and we'll add them to the main style.css after. The reason i made two css styles is soo we can pick the one that we all agree on to use as a team.
IMPORTANT 
there are 4 files in the folder over at the master branch;
Readme.md, review_index.html and
1 folder called "css" which contains
style_option1.css and style_option2.css

NOTE: After cloning through ssh or HTTPS, locate the files on your system explorer and put/paste/place your index.html(which would have your first name for example Joe.html) in that directory otherwise it won't work. For example, i clone the files into my C://Downloads i would copy or move my index.html(in my case Joe.html) and paste it, not in the css folder, but with the Readme.md and the review_index.html in order to be able to use the .css files.

Both the style_option1.css & style_option2.css are to be tested by each user with their index.html and their index.html should be linked to either review_index.html in the master branch or index.html found in the main branch to see which one they like best, give feedback in the discord group [https://discord.gg/J5bTnWhv] and we all pick one because we all have to use the same css for our .html file. To demonstrate, Iverson for example, clones this folder containing all files[Readme.md, review_index.html, folder called "css" which contains style_option1.css, style_option2.css]. If he hasn't already, he creates his html code called "Iverson.html". 

Also, in the review_index.html and index.html theere are these lines found in the body tag;
"<a href="Benjamin.html" class="button button1"> Benjamin</a>
<a href="Zahra.html" class="button button1"> Zahra</a>
<a href="Joe.html" class="button button1"> Joe</a>
<a href="Iverson.html" class="button button1"> Iverson</a>"

If you haven't already, Your individual index.html you created which contains "an image, a paragraph about you and a table of languages you have learned" should be renamed to "firstname.html", for example, if he hasn't already, iverson creates his index.html, for him to be linked to either the "review_index" or index.html found on the master and main branches respectively, he has to rename his index.html to "Iverson.html" as seen in the code above.

He then locates where he cloned the files to and pastes a copy of his "Iverson.html" inside the folder. He goes to his "Iverson.html" code using VScode, Eclipse or whatever text editor he has, look in the head tag <head> </head> of his "Iverson.html" and insert the link--> [Note, insert one .css style link first, see how it looks on your website before you try the other link. Don't post both links in the head tag <head> </head> at the same time] "<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style_option1.css"/>" and when you are done testing it with your index.html, you put the second .css style "<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style_option2.css"/>" Notice that the "css/" represents the folder css and "style_option1.css" & "style_option2.css.html" represents style_option1.css & style_option2.css.

Next, he goes into the css folder, finds the css style he wants to use, either style_option1.css or style_option2.css opens its with notepad or vscode or any text editor, and checks what each variable does, in order to properly use them in his index.html, like <div>, <p1>, <h>, <h1> and so forth. You can also include your own variables based on how you want your index.html to look like. Pleae check online for resources on how to use the tags or your own tags or ask questions in the discord if you need help, you don't have to work alone. 

I also included a file called review_index.html(we is the same as index.html in the main branch) for the purposes of evaluation. Meaning, every user is linked in that review_html or index.html. Run your index.html and see how it feels. That review_index.html or index.html, is what will link all our index.html together so please review it and share your feedback on how to make it better in the Discord link[https://discord.gg/J5bTnWhv ]. 

If you have any questions or you think i forgot something, Discord is the fastest place to get answers, PLEASE DONT STRUGGLE ALONE, we are here for eachother.
Till next time. âœŒ
